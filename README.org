The aim of this package is to provide a set of functions to interact
with CERN's LDAP servers, allowing to lookup users by login and full
name and the membership of user groups. The output is normally
displayed in read-only buffers. Below you can find a list of variables
that can be customised and also the commands that this package
provides. It's recommended though to read the documentation of each
variable and function as this document typically contains only
summaries and brief explanations.

Even though it's obviously tailored to the CERN context and hence with
a rather small audience, this package might also serve as inspiration
for others learning how to talk to LDAP servers using Emacs.

* Licence
See ~COPYING~.

* Disclaimer
This Emacs package has no affiliation whatsoever with [[https://home.cern][CERN]] or the [[https://information-technology.web.cern.ch/][CERN
IT department]] and it's hence not maintained as part of any CERN
project.

However, the [[https://cern.ch/nacho][current maintainer]] (who turns out to be working for CERN
at the moment) will be happy to discuss changes and give a helping
hand but please note that developing ~cern-ldap.el~ is not part of his
paid job.

* Download and installation
The source code is available in Sourcehut and automatically mirrored
to Github for convenience:

- Sourcehut :: https://git.sr.ht/~nbarrientos/cern-ldap.el
- Github (mirror) :: https://github.com/nbarrientos/cern-ldap.el

It'd be cool to make the package available through MELPA but, given
the very scoped audience it has, I imagine it'd be unlikely to be
accepted for distribution. I'll try at some point, though.

** Using ~use-package~

Example installation with ~use-package~ using a local copy:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package cern-ldap
  :ensure nil
  :load-path "~/.emacs.d/local-packages/cern-ldap.el"
  :custom
  (cern-ldap-server-url "ldap://localhost:1389"))
#+end_src

Don't forget to clone the source code into the load path specified
above (or any other of your choice).

* Contributing

Send patches and/or comments to the [[https://lists.sr.ht/~nbarrientos/cern-ldap.el][mailing list]].

* Customisation options
The package allows the user to customise the behaviour of the code in
several ways. Here's just a list of the customisation variables for
quick reference:

- ~cern-ldap-server-url~
- ~cern-ldap-buffer-name-format~
- ~cern-ldap-user-lookup-login-key~
- ~cern-ldap-user-lookup-full-name-key~
- ~cern-ldap-user-full-name-matching-type~
- ~cern-ldap-user-displayed-attributes~
- ~cern-ldap-user-group-membership-filter~
- ~cern-ldap-user-sort-key~

For more information just run ~M-x customize-group cern-ldap~ or read
the documentation of each of the variables listed above, for example
by running ~M-x describe-variable cern-ldap-server-url~.

* User interface
** With explicit input
These commands will always prompt for user input using the minibuffer.

- ~cern-ldap-user-by-login~ :: Lookup a user by login. With prefix
  argument, return more information.
- ~cern-ldap-user-by-full-name~ :: Lookup a user (or several) by full
  name. The search query is enclosed in ~*~ by default, making the
  search query more greedy (see
  ~cern-ldap-user-full-name-matching-type~).
- ~cern-ldap-group~ :: Lookup the members of a group by name. With
  prefix argument, do it non-recursive.

Please refer to the built-in help of each function for further
information.

** With implicit input
The following commands fish the required input from the current
buffer, either from the active region or from the word at point. The
word is collected with ~superword-mode~ enabled so for instance groups
with dashes are picked up.

- ~cern-ldap-user-by-login-dwim~
- ~cern-ldap-user-by-full-name-dwim~
- ~cern-ldap-group-dwim~

Please refer to the built-in help of each function for further
information.

* Keybindings
No keybindings, keymaps or global minor modes are provided. It's up to
the user to configure them to their liking.

** Combining with transient

It might be a good idea to pack these commands in a [[https://github.com/magit/transient][transient]] menu,
for example:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (transient-define-prefix my/cern-ldap-dispatch ()
    "Dispatch CERN LDAP related commands."
    [["LDAP user (by login)"
      ("U" "Dwim" cern-ldap-user-by-login-dwim)
      ("u" "Ask" cern-ldap-user-by-login)]
     ["LDAP user (by full name)"
      ("F" "Dwim" cern-ldap-user-by-full-name-dwim)
      ("f" "Ask" cern-ldap-user-by-full-name)]
     ["LDAP group"
      ("G" "Dwim" cern-ldap-group-dwim)
      ("g" "Ask" cern-ldap-group)]])
#+end_src
